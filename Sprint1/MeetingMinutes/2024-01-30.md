# Meeting 1
#### Date: Tuesday January 30th 2024

It was the first time the full team was present so we started by introducing ourselves briefly. Then we went over the instructions and grading rubric for sprint 1 and created the github repository.

- Assign roles and split the work
- Create a readme file
