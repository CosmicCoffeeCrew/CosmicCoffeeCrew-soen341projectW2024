## Project Description

A car rental app is a digital platform crafted to streamline the vehicle rental process, catering to short-term needs spanning from a few hours to a few weeks. This app acts as a bridge between customers seeking rental vehicles and the car rental company providing such services.

We identify three primary users: Customers, Customer service representatives (CSR), and system administrator(s).


## Technology Stack:

1. Frontend Development:

- Framework: React.js for building interactive user interfaces and managing state efficiently.
- UI Library: Material-UI or Bootstrap for responsive and visually appealing design components.
- State Management: Redux or Context API for centralized state management, ensuring consistency across components.

2. Backend Development:

- Framework: Node.js with Express.js for building scalable and lightweight server-side applications.
- Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing and managing data related to vehicles, users, and rental transactions.
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and authorization of users.
